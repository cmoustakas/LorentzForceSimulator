# LorentzForceSimulator  
  
  The current software is attempting to simulate the behaviour of a particle near a finite long charged wire. It is important to underline that the aforementioned software is just a fun, non-optimized project and as a consequence the reader can feel free to use, modify, improve and play with it.
In order to build the software successfully make sure you have installed cmake 3.x gcc and OpenGL to your machine. Make a directory /build in the projects parent folder and cmake it:  
$ mkdir build && cd build   
$ cmake ..  
$ make  
& ./LorentzForceSimulator  

Enjoy :)
