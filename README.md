# LorentzForceSimulator  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current software is attempting to simulate the behaviour of a particle near a finite long charged wire. It is important to underline that the aforementioned software is just a fun, non-optimized project and as a consequence the reader can feel free to use, modify, improve and play with it. For brief explanation of physics of the project checkout **README.pdf**.
In order to build the software successfully make sure you have installed cmake 3.x gcc and OpenGL to your machine. Make a directory /build in the projects parent folder and cmake it:
  
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build   
$ cmake ..  
$ make  
$ ./LorentzForceSimulator  
```
